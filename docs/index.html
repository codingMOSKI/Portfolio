        <p>This is the first paragraph, and its enclosed by p
                <strong>this is made possible by a self closing element called strong</strong>  Here is <a

            for <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/">color codes you can use for styling</a>.</p>
        <p>Each p element is a <strong>block</strong> element designed to make a block on the
            page.</p>
        <h2>What are block elements good for?</h2>
        <h3>Apparently very large and obvious headings and bold</h3>
        <p>The next element after this is a ul, or <q>unordered list</q>. It makes a bulleted
            list.</p>
        <ul class = "center">
            <li>headings</li>
            <li>paragraphs</li>
            <li>lists</li>
            <li>tables</li>
            <li>images</li>
            <li><strong>this is very cool!</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>How about we look at an ol element, or <q>ordered</q> list? The code looks very similar
            to the <q>unordered</q> list. You have to see the difference by viewing in a web
            browser.</p>
