        <h1>My experience with website making</h1>
        <p>
            There are many challenges involved in this field of work. When it comes to coding and developing websites the main issues involved are due to syntax. I have experience with coding such as c++, python and java so I already have lots of conditioning to this type of development. Still I caught myself double checking and messing up syntax due to being unfamiliar so I would imagine for true beginners it would be quite difficult. The other main challenge I had was due to not being able to accurately move and change how certain texts and images are displayed, it took me a little to understand how to make css for each part and dictate what tag receives what class and why. With word press you don’t have to worry much about any of that, which is the advantage of it. The thing I prefer more about doing the coding on html files and oneself is the experience. Being able to control and code and dictate what happens and why based on coding is very important and pretty cool to me but maybe that's the compsci talking. The challenges of modifying the website when it comes to doing the coding on the website is based on how much you understand css and why certain changes happen. There is a lot to learn and understand when it comes to coding it yourself. It took me a while to understand making css for each tag or making .center for example and being to put that anywhere as a class = “center”. For wordpress I just copy pasted mostly, I didn't have to think about much or try to change much. All of the skills I have mentioned above are necessary and required for making a comprehensible website. When it comes to wordpress you honestly don’t need much skill or knowledge, not nearly as much or as important as doing it yourself. I want to learn more about making and designing how websites look. I would like to experiment with more elegant and planned out ways of making the website and I would like to include java as well. When it comes to website my ultimate goal was to become skilled enough to make a website dedicated to the poems I written my girlfriend and surprise her with it by sending her a link and it just popping up. I am happy and proud to say this class has surpassed my expectations and am capable of doing that within an hour or so now.
