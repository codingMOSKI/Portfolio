            <p>I chose to compare a clasic legendary novel moby dick, which came out in 1851, to a few old news articles from the 2000s. I was hoping to observe the differences in words and tone between a popular fiction novel to the news</p>
            <p>I decided to observe the 2 and 3 word N-Grams to see what the trend was in word choice and topics. When it comes to moby dick , unsuprisingly, they all talk about a subject and most of them is about the whale. </p>
            <figure class = "split">
                <img class = "bigg" src ="pictures/mobyngram.png"/>
                <figcaption>Subjects, Subjects, Subjects</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <figure class = "split">
                <img class = "bigg" src= "pictures/mobyword.png"/>
                <figcaption>Most frequented words in general are of course whale and ship words like man, captain and ye.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Moby Dick has a trend of a majority of the time speaking about subjects and such and less of an action oriented way of writing.</p>
            <p> Now for the news articles! </p>
            
            <figure class = "split">
                <img class = "bigg" src = "pictures/1ngramnews.png"/>
                <figcaption> The government/country and foreign places are the common topics of the news</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>The word collage for the news article shows some trends in the word choice and topic, things like the government, uzbekistan, islamic, regime and rights display a clear focus on politics and such. </p>
            <figure class = "split">
                <img class = "bigg" src = "pictures/newsone.png"/>
                <figcaption> Clearly there was some sort of political turmoil to event going on at the time.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>Taking a complete 180 from political and serious topics, the 2001 news article spends all of it's time talking about film and some man named Gaelan</p>
            <p>compared to Moby Dick which has a very stable and constant line of topics and style the news articles are all over the place in both ways.</p>
            
            <figure class = "split">
                <img class = "bigg" src = "pictures/2001news.png"/>
                <figcaption>As you can see the main topics and used words are in relation to film and the man behind the film, with main features being "his" and the mans name</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>I decided to check out the 2000s article next and wow was I suprised, like I said the topics are all over the place, this article is back to important topics/ the government and treasure island for some reason.</p>
            <p>In comparison to Moby dick the news article have a significant difference in variety and often more direct or action based words in opposition to Moby Dick's common us of "of the"</p>

                <figcaption>I looked into treasure island, it was more political than fun like I thought:(</figcaption>
