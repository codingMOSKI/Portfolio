            <p>I chose to compare a clasic legendary novel, moby dick, to a old news article. I was hoping to observe the differences in words and tone between a popular fiction novel to the news</p>
            <p>I decided to observe the 2 and 3 word N-Grams to see what the trend was in word choice and topics. When it comes to moby dick , unsuprisingly, they all talk about a subject and most of them is about the whale. </p>

                <figcaption>Most frequented words in general are of course whale and ship words like man, captain and ye.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Moby Dick has a trend of a majority of the time speaking about subjects and such and less of an action oriented way of writing.</p>

            <p>The word collage for the news article shows some trends in the word choice and topic, things like the government, uzbekistan, islamic, regime and rights display a clear focus on politics and such. </p>
