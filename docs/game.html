        <h1>Red Finger!</h1>
        
        <p>The game I had decided to play was Red Finger, this was because it had been listed as a horror game and that seemed fun.</p>
        <p>It has a fitting name based on the home screen alone.</p>
        <figure>
            <img class = "bigg" src="pictures/RFhome.png"/>
            <figcaption>As you can see this game boasts a very dark and eerie tone</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>That is one of the components this game does best, the graphics and design are simple yet effective. The world draws you in because it is so dark in most places so your path and what to do is fairly obvious.</p>
        <p>To keep up with the simplicity, this game doesn't have much going on sound wise. It has a eerie ambiance to it and when moving in the elevator and such it just has an effect of pulling the player in because the only noises are just unnerving shaking and ambiance. Taking simple to a whole other level is the setting in this game, there basically aren't any.</p>
        <figure>
            <img class = "bigg" src="pictures/settings.png"/>
            <figcaption>Even the controls list is so incredibly simple</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>Could you have guessed I was going to say the gameplay is simple? It's simple but well done, you are just a finger, you don't ever see any actual character and the only other portion is the left hand. The directions are easy, just go down the elevator and fix some things. It's efficient because the game is so rustic and dark and the player has absouletly no clue on what the danger is or when to expecct it.</p>
        <p>Mainly the player is using the controllable finger to press buttons, the main one being the elevator button in order to advance. The other buttons being the codes you enter to fix the system, which is when the left hand appears holding a piece of paper, and a sink.</p>
        <figure>

            <figcaption>Very simple and rustic, suprisingly intriguing</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>As a player in this game you aren't challenged very much at all, you just go down and enter some already given to you codes. The only threat is a silly robot snake and you don't do much to avoid it. At the end of the game the shaft and locations fills up with water and the player might get stuck if they don't realize they need to leave fast enough but still the game doesn't even completely restart when you die.</p>
        <p>My suggestions for improvement would just be to add more layers to traverse to and make the threat actually a danger</p>
    
    <p>A cool analysis of the in game features!</p>
